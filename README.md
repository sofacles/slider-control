Trying to make a slider controller, and someday it will look like a ruler, with little tickmarks that will
set some value between 0 and n, based on the the slider position.

I got distracted trying to measure the snappiness of different approaches to grabbing the slider with a mouse.

I was inspired by https://blog.logrocket.com/useeffect-vs-uselayouteffect/
But in my case, presumably because this component is so simple and maybe because I am measuring something else,
I am not seeing the big difference that I'd expect and I don't have time to think about it much more now.

Here's the results for different approaches https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17VhLkXP2H6YVElB49sE4CQpdgB4_VDy3hQmTgOjTSw0/edit#gid=0
